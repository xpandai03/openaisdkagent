here's the clean plan to get an "operator-style" agent running with the OpenAI Agents SDK---web search, file search (RAG), **computer use** (control a browser/VM), plus **MCP** tools. i'll give you a minimal working example (python), the computer-use runtime options, and a short prod checklist.

**what you're building (at a glance)**
======================================

-   **agents sdk** is the orchestration layer (instructions, tools, handoffs, guardrails, tracing). 

-   **responses api** model + **hosted tools**: WebSearch, FileSearch (vector stores), ComputerUse. 

-   **computer use** = the same capability behind Operator: the model issues "click/type/scroll" actions; you execute them against a controlled desktop/browser, feed back screenshots, loop until done. 

-   **mcp** adds external tools (filesystem, Firecrawl, GitHub, etc.) via a standard protocol; the Agents SDK natively speaks MCP (stdio/SSE/streamable). 

-   **handoffs** let one agent delegate to another (triage → specialist). Built in. 

-   **tracing** is on by default to debug every tool call and handoff. 

* * * * *

**setup**
=========

```
# 1) deps
pip install openai openai-agents

# 2) env
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Agents SDK quickstart + install docs: pip install openai-agents.

**minimal agent (web search + file search + computer use + mcp)**
=================================================================

```
import asyncio
from agents import (
    Agent, Runner,
    WebSearchTool, FileSearchTool, ComputerTool,
)
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio

# --- tools ---
web = WebSearchTool(  # you can pass location hints via the query text
    max_num_results=3
)

# point to an OpenAI Vector Store you created (for FileSearch/RAG)
rag = FileSearchTool(
    vector_store_ids=["VS_XXXXXXXX"],  # your vector store id
    max_num_results=5
)

# Computer Use: the SDK hosts the tool; you provide the runtime that actually clicks/types.
computer = ComputerTool(
    # optional safety knobs (examples):
    high_risk_operations_enabled=False,
    max_actions_per_run=50
)

# Example MCP server: filesystem (reads/writes inside a sandbox dir)
fs_server = MCPServerStdio(
    params={
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "./sandbox"]
    }
)

# --- agent(s) ---
# Specialist that's allowed to drive the computer
browser_agent = Agent(
    name="BrowserAgent",
    instructions=(
        "You can browse and operate the computer to complete tasks. "
        "Explain your plan briefly, then execute with the computer tool."
    ),
    tools=[computer, web, rag],
    mcp_servers=[fs_server],
)

# Front door agent that can hand off to the browser specialist when needed
triage = Agent(
    name="Triage",
    instructions="Decide whether to answer with search/RAG or hand off to BrowserAgent for on-screen work.",
    tools=[web, rag],
    handoffs=[browser_agent],   # one-line handoff
)

async def main():
    # Example: "Find a black Patagonia jacket near Tokyo and add to cart"
    result = await Runner.run(triage, input=(
        "Find a black Patagonia jacket in Tokyo I'd like, show options, "
        "then use the computer to open the best page and add to cart (stop before purchase)."
    ))
    print(result.final_output)

asyncio.run(main())
```

-   **Hosted tools** (WebSearchTool, FileSearchTool, ComputerTool) are first-class in the SDK; file search targets OpenAI **Vector Stores** you create/upload to. 

-   **Handoffs**: handoffs=[browser_agent] gives the LLM a tool like transfer_to_BrowserAgent. 

-   **MCP**: MCPServerStdio(...) exposes tools (e.g., read_file, write_file) from the filesystem server; you can allow/block specific tools.

> create a vector store & upload docs (for FileSearchTool) using the Vector Stores API, then paste the id into vector_store_ids=[...].

**computer-use runtime (what actually clicks & types)**
=======================================================

The Computer tool issues actions (click/type/etc.). **You** must run a controlled desktop/browser and execute those actions, returning screenshots each step. Two easy paths:

**A) Local sample app (fastest to feel it work)**

Use OpenAI's sample: it spins up a local browser and wires screenshots ⇄ actions for you (Playwright + Docker). Repo includes strong warnings and lockdown options (e.g., DNS block of adult sites, "do not enter credentials"). 

-   Clone **openai/openai-cua-sample-app** and follow docker compose instructions in the README.

-   Launch the app; point your agent run to that runtime (the SDK tool will auto-talk to it if you follow the readme).

-   Keep **purchases disabled** in dev; stop before checkouts (as in the demo).

**B) Hardened container/VM**

For production, run the computer runtime in a **segmented VM/container** (no host creds, outbound allowlist, recording on). The official **Computer Use** guide explains the loop & deployment considerations. 

* * * * *

**enabling web search & file search**
=====================================

-   **Web Search**: the same backend as ChatGPT's Search; enable with WebSearchTool() inside an Agents SDK agent. See the platform guide for behavior & citation style. 

-   **File Search / Vector Stores**: create a Vector Store, upload files, (optionally) tag with metadata filters; then reference its id in FileSearchTool(...). API ref: create stores & add files. 

* * * * *

**wiring MCP tools (examples)**
===============================

MCP lets you snap in ready-made tool servers:

```
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio, create_static_tool_filter

# Filesystem server, but only expose safe ops:
fs_server = MCPServerStdio(
    params={"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "./sandbox"]},
    tool_filter=create_static_tool_filter(allowed_tool_names=["read_file","write_file"])
)

agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="Use tools to achieve the task.",
    mcp_servers=[fs_server]  # add more: Firecrawl, GitHub, etc.
)
```

-   SDK supports **stdio**, **SSE**, **streamable HTTP** MCP transports; you can allowlist/denylist tools or implement dynamic filtering. 

* * * * *

**multi-agent orchestration (handoffs)**
========================================

Keep business logic clean by **separating concerns**: triage agent → specialist agents (browser, refunds, billing, research). Handoffs are built-in and show up in the Traces UI. 

* * * * *

**observability & guardrails**
==============================

-   **Tracing**: auto-enabled; view every LLM turn, tool call, MCP call, and handoff in the OpenAI Traces dashboard. Disable per-run or globally if needed. 

-   **Guardrails**: validate inputs/outputs and break early on violations (e.g., block high-risk computer actions or unknown domains). See Guardrails in the SDK docs. 

* * * * *

**production checklist (short)**
================================

1.  **Computer-use sandbox**: run in an isolated VM/container, no host creds, outbound **domain allowlist**, and disable purchases by default. (The sample app README calls out explicit safety cautions and DNS blocking tips.) 

2.  **Tool allowlists**: use function tools/MCP filters to expose only what you intend. 

3.  **Audit trail**: keep tracing on; export traces to your preferred sink if you want external observability. 

4.  **RAG hygiene**: tag vector-store files with metadata; use filters to keep retrieval tight per tenant/user. 

5.  **Handoffs**: route risky steps to a human-in-the-loop agent or make those tools disabled unless explicitly requested. 

* * * * *

**quick next steps for you**
============================

1.  Create a Vector Store & upload a couple reference docs (docs, URLs you care about). Paste the id into the code. 

2.  Bring up the **computer-use sample runtime** locally via Docker and confirm an end-to-end "open page → add to cart (stop)" dry-run. 

3.  Add one **MCP** server (filesystem to start), allowlist its tools, and test a simple read/write flow. 

4.  Split into **triage + browser agent**, then add web/file search to triage and keep computer use only on the browser agent.

if you want, i can adapt the snippet to your exact stack (Render/n8n, HIPAA hardening, domain allowlists, and a "human-review before checkout" step)---but the above is enough to get a working operator-style agent on your machine today.
